## Interactive Scenario Training Platform 
This repository holds the online platform ISPP. Its purpose as a platform is to provide the creation and taking of interactive assesments with added complexities such as concurrent variables and branching paths for a more indepth assesment.

## Motivation
This project is created by the [Legal Innovation Lab Wales](https://legaltech.wales/) for purposes of creating a platform for charities/organisations to easily create interactive assement tools to simulate situations and assements. Such as interview scenarios, Conversation monitoring and life scenarios.

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

* React. 17.0.1, React router & Bootstrap for styling the front end components

* HTML, CSS + JS. All HTML, CSS and JS

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Check the package.json for dependencies

Build the application from the project root folder

``bundle install``

Run the application

``rails -s``

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
