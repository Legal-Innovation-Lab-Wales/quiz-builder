        <h1>Guide</h1>
        <p>This guide is designed to give you some extra information on how scenarios work and to help you create them.
          It is a work in progress so please bear with us while we get it right</p>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>
          The Scenario is the overall parent structure for the scenario, it will need a name and a description. This
          description should be used to talk about the scenario and provide an introduction.
        <p>
        <p>
          The scenario will also need a set of global variables which will be influenced by the participants chosen
          answers, there is no limit to how many there can be, but generally it's better to try and keep things as
          simple as possible. For example, these could contain values to represent how a character is feeling such as
          anger, fear,
          happiness, trust, and patience. All of these could be influenced in different ways by a participant’s chosen
          answers. Another example could be to represent stats relating to the participant such as health, strength,
          stamina, hunger, thirst and so on.
        </p>

        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>
          A scenario will be comprised of a set of questions. Each question will have the option of either a long
          description, or a short question sentence or both. The description will be displayed before or above the text
          so could be used to provide more exposition or scene setting before asking the specific question which the
          participant will need to answer.
        <p>
          A question can be multiple choice (select all where apply) or single answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each question will also hold a reference number. This is used to uniquely identify questions within the flow
          of the scenario. Based on the participants previous answer, there will be a corresponding follow up question
          reference number to link to. This enables branching off and a more interactive experience where participants
          are lead them down different paths so the order of which they encounter the questions will likely be different
          for each user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the scenario you are building, there could be one or many final questions which act as the
          outcome of the scenario. These will be displayed with the final variable scores. Please give the order number
          for this as “End”
        </p>

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          Each question can have as many answer choices as required. Each answer needs three things: some text to
          describe the choice, the changes to any variables as a consequence of selecting the answer, what the next
          question in the order will be. Reference number of next question The variable changes and the next question in
          the order will not be visible to the participant
        </p>


        <h5>Example</h5>

        <p><strong>Question Background</strong> You have a 10.00 am appointment. At 10.00 am, there is a knock at the

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Variable Changes</strong> (No change to any of the
          barometers) <strong>Next Question</strong> [Question 1a]
        </p>

        <p class="mb-0">
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Answering the door, explaining that you are finishing up another case,

          them at 10.15 am
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Variable Changes</strong> (No change to any of the barometers) <strong>Next Question</strong>

        </p>

        <p class="mb-0">
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Calling out to come in
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Variable Changes</strong> (Fear rises by 1 point) <strong>Next Question</strong> [Question 2]
