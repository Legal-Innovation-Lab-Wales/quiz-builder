        <p>The Scenario Platform facilitates the creation of non-linear branching scenarios where each answer that a
          participant selects can influence a range of background variables and link to an arbitrary next question.</p>

        <p>This platform was initially scoped for training solicitors with practise interview scenarios. As the project
          developed there was a wider demand beyond the scope for a platform in other areas such as rehabilitation,
          medical scenario and customer service training</p>

        <p>It was created by the Legal Innovation Lab Wales which is an ERDF funded project and part of the Hilary
          Rodham Clinton School of Law at Swansea University. You can find out more about the lab at
          <a href="https://legaltech.wales">LegalTech.Wales.</a></p>

        <p>If you're interested in a demo of the software, finding out more or setting up an organisation of your own on
          the platform then please <a href="mailto:sceanario-platform@legaltech.wales">send us an email.</a></p>

        <p>If you're looking for more information on how to build scenarios then we have a <a href="/guide">guide</a>
          which will hopefully help. </p>

        <p>This is an early prototype, we know its a little rough around the edges and there is lots of room for improvement. If you have any suggestions as to how we can improve it, the please get in touch and let us know.</p>

        <p>
          Some of the improvements we have planned include:
          <ul>
            <li>Add warning on making scenario available if its incomplete.</li>
            <li>Add hints and tips to create and update forms, and around the scenario builder</li>
            <li>Improving the look and feel of the emails you receive</li>
            <li>Admins receive an email when they have new members to confirm in their organisation</li>
            <li>Improvements to management of your organisation</li>
            <li>Improvements of the admin view on mobile</li>
            <li>Allowing Multi-select answers</li>
            <li>Allow more formatting of scenario and question descriptions</li>
            <li>Improve error message when invalid question order is added</li>
            <li>Provide more information to make it easier to set question order</li>
            <li>Make it easier to add final question in scenario (no more "-1")</li>
          </ul>
