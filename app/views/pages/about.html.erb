        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The Scenario Platform facilitates the creation of non-linear branching scenarios where each answer that a
          participant selects can influence a range of background variables and link to an arbitrary next question.</p>

        <p>It was initially designed to allow trainee solicitors to practice specific interview situations. It was built
          to allow a wider range of options include social interaction scenarios such as rehabilitation or customer
          service training, interactive storytelling including 'choose your own' adventures and complex medical
          situations.</p>

        <p>It was created by the Legal Innovation Lab Wales which is an ERDF funded project and part of the Hilary
          Rodham Clinton School of Law at Swansea University. You can find out more about the lab at
          <a href="https://legaltech.wales">LegalTech.Wales.</a></p>

        <p>If you're interested in a demo of the software, finding out more or setting up an organisation of your own on
          the platform then please <a href="mailto:sceanario-platform@legaltech.wales">send us an email.</a></p>

        <p>If you're looking for more information on how to build scenarios then we have a <a href="/guide">guide</a> which will hopefully help. </p>
